## Future Improvements

The app is a work in progress, and I plan to keep building on it by adding features such as:

1. User authentication
2. Persistent chat history
3. Private messaging
4. Online/offline status for users
5. Typing indicators
6. Message reactions
7. File attachments

## How to Run

1. Install the required dependencies in both the `client` and `server` folders by running `npm install`.
2. Start the server by running `npm start` in the `server` folder.
3. Start the client by running `npm run dev` in the `client` folder.
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.
